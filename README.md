# CV Project

## A basic CV builder app that lets you create a resume by filling out simple forms.

This project was built while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The app is functional, but does not allow user to export pdf. Try out the demo below.

## What could be improved

* Export pdf
* More options to be added for resume (skills, personal values, etc.)
